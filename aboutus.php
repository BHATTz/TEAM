                The dairy industry has been around for centuries; nevertheless,
                it has undergone several transformations throughout history. In
                ancient times, cheese was made from curdled milk or from the
                curdled whey left after churning butter. In Greco-Roman era,
                cheese was sold in pottery jars to avoid contamination from
                bacteria. Later on, coke (refined) milk was produced by
                separating the whole milk into skimmed and concentrated forms.
                During this period of transformations, the dairy industry became
                complicated as it required different skills and skill sets which
                were acquired through education or professional experience. In
                addition to that, there are different stages in the production
                process such as animal breeding, milking, processing, packaging
                and distribution of dairy products worldwide. Furthermore, there
                are different types of dairy products such as fresh or processed
                milk which include yogurt, butter or cheese among others.

              <br /><br />
              <p>
                The dairy industry is a major contributor to the economy in many
                countries including Australia, Canada, China and the United
                States where there are over 200 million cows producing 27
                billion gallons of milk annually1 . In the US alone over $22
                billion is spent yearly on dairy products2 . According to
                experts surveyed by Agri-Food Canada on trends in the Canadian
                dairy industry from 2016 to 20223 , demand for Canadian dairy
                products is increasing due to population growth and economic
                development4 . With this increase in demand for Canadian dairy
                products also comes increase in health standards for these
                products such as pasteurization— which kills bacteria — cooling
                systems — which reduces bacterial growth — probiotics — which
                add beneficial bacteria to produce yogurt5 . There are two main
                types of pasteurization processes used today: thermal (heat)
                pasteurization at 118°F (48°C) for 15 seconds followed by
                holding at 131°F (55°C) for 15 seconds; and enzymatic (yeast)
                pasteurization at 162°F (72°C) for 30 seconds followed by
                holding at 180F (82C) for 2 minutes6 .

              <p>
                Global demand for milk and milk products has increased due to
                modern technology such as refrigeration systems that keep
                perishable foods cold without using ice— thus reducing energy
                consumption7 . Furthermore, global agricultural growth has
                increased global demand even more8 since people with an adequate
                income can purchase quality foodstuff such as dairy products9 .
                Urbanization has also contributed to increased demand since
                cities have limited space available for storing foodstuff10 .
                Therefore urban residents rely more on packaged foodstuff that
                requires minimal storage compared with rural residents who have
                less access to these types of foodstuffs11 . For example: city
                dwellers can purchase fresh meat daily compared with rural
                dwellers who may only eat meat once a week or less12 .

              India ranks first among the world’s milk producing Nations since
              1998 and has the largest bovine population in the World. Milk
              production in India during the period 1950-51 to 2017-18, has
              increased from 17 million tonnes to 176.4 million tonnes as
              compared to 165.4 million tonnes during 2016-17 recording a growth
              of 6.65 %. FAO reported 1.46% increase in world milk Production
              from 800.2 million tonnes in 2016 to 811.9(Estim) million tonnes
              in 2017. The per capita availability of milk in the country which
              was 130 gram per day during 1950-51 has increased to 374 gram per
              day in 2017-18 as against the world estimated average consumption
              of 294 grams per day during 2017. This represents sustained growth
              in the availability of milk and milk products for our growing
              population. gDairying has become an important secondary source of
              income for millions of rural families and has assumed the most
              important role in providing employment and income generating
              opportunities particularly for marginal and women farmers.
