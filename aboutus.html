                Dairy Sector

                The dairy industry has been around for centuries; nevertheless,
                it has undergone several transformations throughout history. In
                ancient times, cheese was made from curdled milk or from the
                curdled whey left after churning butter. In Greco-Roman era,
                cheese was sold in pottery jars to avoid contamination from
                bacteria. Later on, coke (refined) milk was produced by
                separating the whole milk into skimmed and concentrated forms.
                During this period of transformations, the dairy industry became
                complicated as it required different skills and skill sets which
                were acquired through education or professional experience. In
                addition to that, there are different stages in the production
                process such as animal breeding, milking, processing, packaging
                and distribution of dairy products worldwide. Furthermore, there
                are different types of dairy products such as fresh or processed
                milk which include yogurt, butter or cheese among others.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                The dairy industry is a major contributor to the economy in many
                countries including Australia, Canada, China and the United
                States where there are over 200 million cows producing 27
                billion gallons of milk annually1 . In the US alone over $22
                billion is spent yearly on dairy products2 . According to
                experts surveyed by Agri-Food Canada on trends in the Canadian
                dairy industry from 2016 to 20223 , demand for Canadian dairy
                products is increasing due to population growth and economic
                development4 . With this increase in demand for Canadian dairy
                products also comes increase in health standards for these
                products such as pasteurization— which kills bacteria — cooling
                systems — which reduces bacterial growth — probiotics — which
                add beneficial bacteria to produce yogurt5 . There are two main
                types of pasteurization processes used today: thermal (heat)
                pasteurization at 118°F (48°C) for 15 seconds followed by
                holding at 131°F (55°C) for 15 seconds; and enzymatic (yeast)
                pasteurization at 162°F (72°C) for 30 seconds followed by
                holding at 180F (82C) for 2 minutes6 .

              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Global demand for milk and milk products has increased due to
                modern technology such as refrigeration systems that keep
                perishable foods cold without using ice— thus reducing energy
                consumption7 . Furthermore, global agricultural growth has
                increased global demand even more8 since people with an adequate
                income can purchase quality foodstuff such as dairy products9 .
                Urbanization has also contributed to increased demand since
                cities have limited space available for storing foodstuff10 .
                Therefore urban residents rely more on packaged foodstuff that
                requires minimal storage compared with rural residents who have
                less access to these types of foodstuffs11 . For example: city
                dwellers can purchase fresh meat daily compared with rural
                dwellers who may only eat meat once a week or less12 .

                Milk is an important part of many people’s diets, but can be a
                controversial one. In addition to being a major part of the food
                industry and public health, milk comes from animals that are
                milked by mammals. This is how the milk industry functions. The
                milk is extracted from cows and goats and processed into dairy
                products. Even though most people know that milk comes from
                cows, it can be difficult to understand the complex nature of
                this industry.

              <p>
                The dairy industry is under pressure from consumers to eat less
                or healthier versions of products containing milk proteins. This
                has led to constant scrutiny of the dairy industry by
                governments, non-profit organizations and media outlets. For
                example, in 2015 the UK’s National Health Service launched a
                campaign against high-fat dairy products called “Don’t Play with
                your Food” because it promotes eating less fat. The goal of this
                campaign is to encourage people to cut back on high-fat dairy
                products like cheese and ice cream and choose lower-fat versions
                instead. In response, dairy companies work closely with
                governments to promote good nutritional habits while limiting
                health warnings about eating too much dairy products.

          India ranks first among the world’s milk producing Nations since 1998
          and has the largest bovine population in the World. Milk production in
          India during the period 1950-51 to 2017-18, has increased from 17
          million tonnes to 176.4 million tonnes as compared to 165.4 million
          tonnes during 2016-17 recording a growth of 6.65 %. FAO reported 1.46%
          increase in world milk Production from 800.2 million tonnes in 2016 to
          811.9(Estim) million tonnes in 2017. The per capita availability of
          milk in the country which was 130 gram per day during 1950-51 has
          increased to 374 gram per day in 2017-18 as against the world
          estimated average consumption of 294 grams per day during 2017. This
          represents sustained growth in the availability of milk and milk
          products for our growing population. gDairying has become an important
          secondary source of income for millions of rural families and has
          assumed the most important role in providing employment and income
          generating opportunities particularly for marginal and women farmers.
          There is a need of Developing a mobile App for online processing and
          registration of dairy farmers producing milk and other livestock
          products organically. Such an app may help provide market linkage.
